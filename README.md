## Appyx Navigation

This is a simple demo to show how to navigation is made simpler using Appyx.
Using Appyx you need Nodes which are the main structural element in Appyx. They can form a tree.
You can think of a Node as a standalone unit of your app with:

- Its own AppyxComponent
- Its own Lifecycle
- State restoration
- A @Composable view
- Business logic that's kept alive even when the view isn't added to the composition
